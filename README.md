# Making a binary search algorithm 🎉
My first time implementing binary search. This just uses random sorted integers but obviously in the future
I could apply this same method to access whatever contiguous info I wanted.

## Goals:
- [x] Create an array of randomized integers
- [x] One or two algorithms to sort array
- [x] Find any given integer in the array using binary search
